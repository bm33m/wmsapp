In a Software Engineering world big projects are divided into mile stones a.k.a. phases or versions.
In open source stack there is always a continuous improvements on the code, hence now and then there is a new version of the code. For example, a project can be divided into 3 milestones or phases. There is no such thing as impossible, analyze it, look it in all angles....


Enjoy...:-)
